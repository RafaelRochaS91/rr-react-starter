# RR React Starter  
  
## Overview  
  
This React-Redux starter was tailored by me for my development processes and it includes:  
* React + ReactDOM;
* Redux + React-Redux;
* Redux-Thunk (Middleware);
* Jest (Testing utilities);
* Material-UI (Component Library).  
  
## Installation  

    $ git clone git@github.com:RafaRochaS91/rr-react-starter.git <project_name>  

    $cd <project_name> && npm install  
    $rm -rf git && git init
    $npm start  

Navigate to localhost:3000 but by default Webpack-Dev-Server opens new tab in default browser.  
  
### If you have any ideas of how this can contribute to better kickstart any React-Redux projects or if you want to report some issue please either request a pull or open an issue. Thanks!
